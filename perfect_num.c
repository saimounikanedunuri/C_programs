/* Perfect Number - A perfect number is a positive integer number which is equals to the sum of its proper positive divisors. For example 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, 3 and itâ€™s sum is equals to 6.
Write a C program to check whether a given number (N) is a perfect number or not? */
